Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _17.478 Great Power Military Intervention_ as it was taught by Professor Roger Petersen and Professor Barry Posen in Fall 2013.

This course examined systematically, and comparatively, great and middle power military interventions, and candidate interventions into civil wars from the 1990’s to the present. This course also asked what the experiences of the 1990’s can teach us about similar, but not identical, subsequent interventions and candidate interventions.
